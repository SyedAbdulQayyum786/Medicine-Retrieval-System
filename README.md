# Medicine Retrieval System 💊

The **Medicine Retrieval System** is an information retrieval project built using Python. This system processes user queries (diseases) and suggests the best matching medicines based on the entered disease.

## 🌟 About the Project

This project leverages the principles of **information retrieval** to build an intelligent system that preprocesses user input, matches it against a database of diseases and medicines, and returns the most relevant medicines.

## 🚀 Features

1. **Query Preprocessing**:
   - User queries are cleaned, tokenized, and processed to ensure accurate matching.

2. **Disease-to-Medicine Mapping**:
   - The system uses a database of diseases and their corresponding medicines to suggest the most relevant results.

3. **Efficient Search**:
   - Implements information retrieval techniques for fast and accurate medicine retrieval.

4. **User-Friendly Output**:
   - Displays the best-matched medicines for the entered disease in a clean and concise format.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - NLTK (for natural language processing)
  - Pandas (for managing the disease-medicine dataset)
  - NumPy (for efficient computations)
  - Scikit-learn (for potential enhancements like similarity scoring)
- **Dataset**: A custom dataset of diseases and their associated medicines
